# Medical Disease Prediction & Recommendation ü©∫

Welcome to the **Medical Disease Prediction & Recommendation System**! This project leverages machine learning to predict diseases based on user-input symptoms and then provides recommendations for precautions, medications, diet, and workouts. The interactive web app is built using Streamlit with an attractive, custom UI.

## Overview üöÄ

The **Medical Disease Prediction & Recommendation System** aims to help users quickly identify potential health issues based on their symptoms. The app utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel to generate predictions. In addition, it provides personalized recommendations for:

- **Precautions**
- **Medications**
- **Diet Plans**
- **Workout Suggestions**

All this is delivered through a user-friendly, interactive interface built with Streamlit.

## Features üí°

- **Interactive User Interface:** Designed with Streamlit and enhanced with custom CSS and a background image.
- **Disease Prediction:** Uses a pre-trained SVM model to predict diseases based on selected symptoms.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Offers detailed advice on precautions, medications, diet, and workouts.
- **Dataset-Driven Insights:** Leverages a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle.
- **Aesthetic Design:** The UI features a visually appealing background image (embedded via base64 encoding) and modern styling.

## Dataset üìä

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:

- **[Disease Symptom Description Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset)**

This dataset includes detailed information about various diseases, their symptoms, descriptions, and recommendations, making it a robust resource for building a healthcare prediction system.
